# password_manager (not finished)
Offline password manager that uses python and SQL database 
The main user that you create in the first place is the main 'model' that you will use in order to store your passwords.
You can change that by either creating a new user, (which will take more time due to the different names you can use everytime)
Or you can simply change the value of the name and / or the email, which just results in creating a new "user";

I cannot guarantee that this script is safe from sql injections (not tested yet) or any other forms of attacks, so please note that it is not as safe as
Keepass or other similar softwares, it should be used only at your own risks. Or, you can always download and modify the script so that you can yourself make it more safe.
