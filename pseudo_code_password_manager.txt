check if user is root, if not, ask him to log as root
def root:
    check if user is root, if not, ask him to log as root then exit
    if user is root, start function database_exists()

def database_exists():
    check_user()
    if database does not exist, start check_user(), then create a database, then database_methods()
    if database exists, check_user() then  start database_methods()

def database_methods():
    methods should consist of :
    (specific searchs options later (wide search, alphabet, time created))
        Create password
            function generate_password(), is supposed to store it with an sql udpate request to the database (ask user for other credentials to store)
        Search password
            is supposed to query the database with an sql request (with anything on the table except password), then decrypt the password and print it
            give true if task was executed properly or false if password does not exist (false query)
        Update password
            Is supposed to use function search_password() first then update the password with an sql update request
            give true if task was executed properly or false if password does not exist (false query) 
        Delete password
            is supposed to query the database with a delete request (delete a line, but you cannot delete a line in the table users
            give true if task was executed properly or false if password does not exist (error request)

def print_database(table):
    #just prints database as such:
    
                            TABLE (PASSWORD)
    | 2ndary_key(id)  | website           | password  |    date    |  
    |       1         | anydomainname.com | ********* | 04/03/2022 |

                            TABLE (USERS)
    | primary_key(id)  | user  |     e-mail           | 
    |          1       | clw0n | clw0n@domain.me      | 
    |          2       | clw0n | clw0n@otherdomain.me |

      # printing database should always hide the passwords
      # passwords should always be hashed

other functions should consist of:
    def hash_password():
        hash any password
    
    def decrypt_password():
        decrypt the chosen password
    
    def check_user():
        ask user master key login
        If master key does not exist, ask to create one and hash master_key
